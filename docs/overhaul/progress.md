## 2026-07-22 — Phase 2 (partial): Master key fail-closed (critical security fix)

**What was done**
- Implemented ADR-009 / threat 2.2: the master encryption key is now resolved **fail-closed**.
  Previously it silently fell back to a public default — in code *and* hardcoded in
  `appsettings.json` — so with `HARBORA_MASTER_KEY` unset, all "encrypted" secrets were trivially
  decryptable. Fixed both instances.

**Files changed**
- Added `src/Harbora.Infrastructure/Security/MasterKeyResolver.cs` (pure policy: Production must
  have a secure key; rejects known-insecure placeholders; Development uses a dev key with a loud
  warning).
- `DependencyInjection.cs`: use the resolver; coalesce a blank appsettings value through to the env
  var; print a warning when the dev fallback is used.
- `appsettings.json`: removed the insecure `Harbora:MasterKey` default (now blank).
- `appsettings.Development.json`: added a dev-only key for local convenience.
- Added `tests/Harbora.Tests/MasterKeyResolverTests.cs` (8 tests).

**Tests / checks run**
- `dotnet build Harbora.slnx -c Release` → 0 warnings / 0 errors.
- `dotnet test` → **31 passed** (was 24; +7 net).
- Runtime (built DLL, real Postgres): Production **without** a key → aborts with the precise
  message; Production **with** an env key → `/healthz` 200; Development (no env key) → boots and
  prints the INSECURE-key warning.

**Result**
- SUCCESS. The platform's most serious "insecure default" is closed and covered by tests.

**Decisions**
- Marked BREAKING (semver-major): existing Production installs that never set `HARBORA_MASTER_KEY`
  will now refuse to boot. Justified (it's a real vulnerability), low blast radius (the installer
  already generates the key in `deploy/.env`), and documented as a migration note (doc 11 §2.3).
  This is the one intentional breaking default in the overhaul; per the escalation rules it is
  reversible (unset the check) and non-destructive, so proceeded and recorded.

**Next step**
- P2 remainder needs a Docker host: reproduce install + one real end-to-end deploy (image + git),
  recorded here. Then P3 — deployment state machine + crash reconciler (ADR-004/005).

## 2026-07-22 — Phase 0–1: Guardrails & protective tests (execution begins)

**What was done**
- Created branch `overhaul` (off `84603e0`).
- **P0 — guardrails:** added a solution-wide CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: restore →
  build → test, plus a frontend job that runs `npm ci && npm run build` so a broken Vue bundle
  fails CI); added `.editorconfig` (promotes the unused-parameter warning CS9113 to an **error** so
  dead ctor params can't return); fixed the 3 pre-existing warnings.
- **P1 — protective tests:** added the first-ever test project `tests/Harbora.Tests` (xUnit +
  FluentAssertions) with 24 characterization tests over the highest-risk pure logic:
  secret protector (round-trip, non-determinism, wrong-key + tamper rejection), PBKDF2 hasher
  (verify + salting), secret redactor, buildpack detection (per-stack + precedence + no-match),
  and the Traefik renderer/validator (router/service YAML, cert resolver, priority ordering,
  and the validation gate: missing host, bad port, redirect-without-target, duplicate warning).

**Files changed**
- Added: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.editorconfig`,
  `tests/Harbora.Tests/{Harbora.Tests.csproj,SecurityTests.cs,BuildpackTests.cs,TraefikProxyEngineTests.cs}`.
- Edited (warning fixes, removed unused `clock` param): `GitWebhookProcessor.cs`,
  `ManagedServiceEngine.cs`, `AppsController.cs`.
- Solution: `Harbora.slnx` (added test project).

**Tests / checks run**
- `dotnet build Harbora.slnx -c Release` → **Build succeeded, 0 warnings, 0 errors** (was 3
  warnings).
- `dotnet test Harbora.slnx -c Release` → **24 passed, 0 failed**.

**Result**
- SUCCESS. The protective net is live and green; the build is warning-clean; CI will gate future
  PRs on both backend tests and a successful frontend bundle build.

**Decisions**
- Removed the 3 unused `clock` primary-constructor parameters rather than suppressing the warning
  (cleaner; DI unaffected). Recorded because it slightly changes 3 constructor signatures (no
  behavior change).
- Started tests at the pure-logic tier (no Docker/DB needed) so the net exists before any core
  refactor; integration/E2E tiers (Testcontainers) come with the phases that need them (doc 13).

**Next step**
- P2: on a Docker-capable host, reproduce install + run one real end-to-end deploy (image + git)
  and record it here; implement the master-key **fail-closed in Production** check (ADR-009) with a
  unit test. Then P3 (deployment state machine + crash reconciler).

## 2026-07-22 — Phase 0: Discovery, market research, and design (baseline)

**What was done**
- Cloned `github.com/sadrazkh/Harbora` @ `84603e0` (branch `master`).
- Read the full repository (Domain/Application/Infrastructure/Data/Web/Agent/Cli/Shared, installer,
  compose, Traefik config, CLI, Vue islands, all controllers/views).
- Installed .NET 10 SDK (10.0.107) and PostgreSQL 15 in the workspace.
- Established the **build baseline** and a **runtime baseline** of the panel.
- Ran deep competitor research across 25 products (5 parallel research agents).
- Wrote the first design documents (see below).

**Files changed**
- Added `docs/overhaul/01-current-state-assessment.md`, `02-competitor-research.md`, `progress.md`
  (more docs landing in this phase).
- No source files changed yet (discovery only).

**Tests / checks run**
- `dotnet restore Harbora.slnx` → success.
- `dotnet build Harbora.slnx -c Release` → **Build succeeded, 0 errors, 3 warnings** (unread
  `clock` primary-constructor parameters in `GitWebhookProcessor`, `ManagedServiceEngine`,
  `AppsController`).
- `dotnet run --project src/Harbora.Web` against PostgreSQL 15 → boots, applies **5 migrations**,
  seeds **7 templates / 5 instance sizes / 3 plans / 1 local server**.
- Authenticated UI walk (cookie session): **16/16 routes → HTTP 200** (`/`, `/apps`,
  `/apps/create`, `/deployments`, `/git`, `/domains`, `/routes`, `/databases`,
  `/databases/create`, `/backups`, `/monitoring`, `/servers`, `/plans`, `/tenants`, `/templates`,
  `/settings`).
- `npm run build` (Vue islands) → **blocked** by the sandbox package-registry firewall
  (`registry.npmjs.org` 403 on transitive `ws`/`vite` tarballs). Environmental, not a project
  defect; fallback CSS keeps the shell usable.

**Result**
- SUCCESS for build + backend runtime baseline. Frontend bundle build deferred to a normal network.
- Docker is unavailable in this sandbox → container/deploy/metrics runtime paths were verified by
  **code reading only**. They must be validated on a Docker host as execution step 0.

**Key findings / decisions**
- The codebase is a genuine, well-structured modular monolith — **keep the foundation, don't
  rewrite.**
- Critical gaps identified: **no tests / no CI gate (C1)**; **deploy lifecycle not crash-safe
  (C2)**; **compose/static/template deploy sources advertised but throw `NotSupported` (C3)**;
  **health/cutover not zero-downtime (C4)**. Full list in doc 01 §5.
- Decision: overhaul order = stabilize (tests+CI+real deploy smoke) → fix domain/state-machine core
  → close claimed-but-missing gaps → layer differentiators. Recorded in doc 12.

**Next step**
- Finish the remaining design docs (03–14).
- Create the `overhaul` branch, add a solution build+test CI workflow, and stand up the first test
  project (characterization tests around Traefik rendering, buildpack detection, slug/host logic,
  secret protector) — the protective net required before any refactor.
- On a Docker-capable host: reproduce the baseline and run one real end-to-end deploy (prebuilt
  image + git repo); record the outcome here.
